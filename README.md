 DATA ANALYTICS 
Project Title: Customer Segmentation and Sales Prediction for E-commerce
1. Project Overview
Objective: To identify customer segments and predict future sales for an e-commerce platform to enhance marketing strategies and inventory management.
Scope: Analysis will cover customer purchasing behavior, product preferences, and sales trends over the past three years.
2. Business Understanding
Business Goals:
Increase marketing campaign effectiveness.
Optimize inventory based on predicted sales.
Improve customer satisfaction by personalized offerings.
Key Questions:
What are the distinct customer segments?
What factors influence customer purchasing behavior?
How can we predict future sales trends?
3. Data Understanding
Data Sources:
Transactional Data: Order details, product information, sales records.
Customer Data: Demographics, purchase history, customer feedback.
Web Data: Website clickstream, browsing history.
Data Collection Methods: Extract from databases, web scraping, APIs.
Data Description: Types, formats, and summary statistics.
4. Data Preparation
